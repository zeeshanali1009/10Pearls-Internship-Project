I am doing an internship in the 10Pearls software house and I will be making the exciting projects ahead.
1. Air Quality Index Checker Application
   I will be making a real time weather app that predicts the weather condition according to the existing real time data.It will help me alot in gaining the real time experience of how things are gonna working out.
Here we have the following instructions
- You will be building an AQI (Air Quality Index) Analysis bot for your city.
As part of the project, you will work with:
- Data collection (using any API you like)
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection 
- Uploading Features to Feature store (such as Hopsworks)
- Training your own chosen models on your dataset.
- Analyzing and Reporting results
- A small frontend (could be on streamlit or gradio)
And importantly a
- CI/CD pipeline (using Github actions)

We will upload the task documents for this project this week.
I will do some of the more exciting projects aswell.
